				Ceramic Coating
			</span>
		</h1>
		Industry-grade ceramic coating is a chemical polymer solution that is applied to the exterior of a vehicle to protect it from external paint damage. Typically applied by hand, it blends with the paint of your car and creates an additional hydrophobic layer of protection.
		<br>
		<br>
		Due to this chemical bonding and creation of a new layer, the car’s factory paint job remains untouched.While many car enthusiasts and even detailers believe it to be an alternative to clear bra (paint protection film), ceramic coating, in reality, is an alternative to waxing. The main idea is to prevent dirt, grime, and stain marks from appearing on the paint job and ruining the clear coat.
		<br>
		<br>
		Ceramic coating, also sometimes called nano-ceramic coating, is a permanent or semi-permanent solution to your worries depending upon the coating and type of polymer used. Due to its chemically intrinsic properties, it does not break down in normal atmospheric conditions like rain or summer.
		<br>
		<br>
		Modesta, Nanolex, CQuartz, Ceramic Pro and IGL Kenzo are some of most popular brands of ceramic coating today. They are widely used in and around the state. But before you decide if you really want to try it out, let’s dig deeper.

				CERAMIC COATING 
			</span>
			 : ADVANTAGES & BENEFITS
		</h1>
		Take anything that contains chemical compounds and you are looking at a resilient solution. Same goes for ceramic coating, which is both permanent and easier to clean once applied. Other than the obvious, here are a few more reasons to apply it in your car:
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Protection from Harmful UV Rays</I></h2>
		<br>
		You can only imagine the damage that the sun’s harmful UV rays can do to your car’s paint job. Ceramic coating will protect your car’s paint from oxidizing, preventing it from fading and wearing a dull look. This is absolutely critical if you park your car outside.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Protection from Chemical Stains</I></h2>
		<br>
		Chemical stains arising from acidic contaminants in the air is another potential damage to your car. A coating will prevent these contaminants from bonding into the paint. With air pollution rate only rising in the city, ceramic coating can be a huge relief.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Hydrophobic Nature, Ease of Cleaning</I></h2>
		<br>
		When it comes to waxing and other types of detailing, washing your car becomes a headache. With ceramic coating, you don’t have to worry about the polymer wearing off. (Incidentally, removing it completely requires another process involving a polishing and wet-sanding.)
		<br><br>
		Not only does it blend with your car’s paint but also repels water. This means that all water-based dirt and grime will bead on the surface and eventually slide off. A quick jet wash afterward and you have yourself a spotless, ageless car.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Candy-Like Gloss</I></h2>
		<br>
		This is where the aesthetics all car owners will love. Much like car bra, ceramic coating also gloss and depth into your car’s paint. It will give your car a glossy look, bringing the best out of the original paint job.
		<br><br>
		All of these benefits have revealed the truth about ceramic coating, haven’t they? Over the past few years, its popularity has only risen in and around the state. Reviews from both users and auto industry experts have been extremely positive.

			MYTHS ABOUT 
			<span class="text-primary text-uppercase">
				CERAMIC COATING 
			</span>
		</h1>
		Every product in the world has drawbacks. Whether they are deal breakers or not is for us to decide. These are not exactly demerits; just things that ceramic coating just does not promise to do.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Protection from All Types of Scratches and Swirl Marks</I></h2>
		<br>
		Ceramic coating will not protect your car from the usual threats: scratches, swirl marks, and rock chips. Despite its blending properties, it still retains the characteristics of paint. This is why you should still expect your car to be at the receiving end of these common, undesirable elements.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Protection from Water Spotting</I></h2>
		<br>
		As discussed before, after the application of ceramic coating, water-based contaminants will bead on your car’s surface and eventually slide off. But they still contain natural minerals and soluble particles that will stay on the surface after the water has evaporated. Ceramic coating cannot get rid of the water spots that are produced as a result, removal of which will require a far more hands-on approach.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Stop the Need for Car Wash</I></h2>
		<br>
		You will still need to regularly wash your car. A layer of ceramic coating does not give your car superpowers to auto-clean itself. While we are all waiting for a miracle product that would do that, for now, let’s focus on the bright side of ceramic coating.
