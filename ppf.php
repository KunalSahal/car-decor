				Paint Protection Film
			</span>
			 [PPF]
		</h1>
		A paint protection film is the best example of an aftermarket product that truly works as advertised. Its primary task is indeed – to protect the paint surface and other materials where it’s applied. PPF (which is an abbreviation for this super paint protection film) is a polyurethane-based substance. It’s transparent, and with some elevated brands, it can instantly heal if the top layer is scratched. So, is it a good idea to install PPF on new cars?
		<br>
		<br>
		In short – absolutely. In fact, this is the best time to apply PPF – or elastomeric polymer film as the primary objective of protective paint films is to maintain the condition of what’s underneath from UV exposure, chemicals, light scratches, toxins, and road grime.
		<br>
		<br>
		However, PPF is not for everyone. It is a premium product that is typically installed by certified and highly-trained professionals. And there are times when protection film installation is not recommended. So, let’s explore some of the pros and cons of having a clear bra or paint protection film bonded to your new car’s paint surface.

			 : ADVANTAGES & BENEFITS
		</h1>
		If you’re going to invest in a paint protection film to keep your new vehicle’s paintjob and other parts in mint condition, there are several advantages to consider.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Produces an enhanced finish</I></h2>
		<br>
		While some PPF’s might improve the shine of your vehicle, Ceramic Pro Kavaca is available in a gloss or matte finish. In fact, if you have a high gloss paintjob, you can apply Kavaca Matte – to instantly create a brilliant and customized exterior look and appeal.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Reduced orange peel and lack of glue marks</I></h2>
		<br>
		It’s common for some paint protection films to leave glue marks after the installation. Kavaca’s proprietary adhesive does not leave these marks or creates an orange peel finish.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Superior protection against chemicals and corrosion</I></h2>
		<br>
		Kavaca instant healing protective films are infused with four layers of material, each of them providing roadblocks for harmful contaminants or chemicals to penetrate. It also provides superior stain resistance and reduces paint damage due to stone chips.
		<br><br>
		<h2><I>Instant healing of minor scratches</I></h2>
		<br>
		Most of the top brands of car paint protection have self-healing properties. This means, that minor scratches can be fixed by a detailer, simply by applying direct heat – or with a blowing heat gun. Kavaca is the ONLY Instant Healing PPF on the market today. It uses nano technology to fill minor scratches within a few seconds.
		<br><br>
		All of these benefits have revealed the truth about PPF, haven’t they? Over the past few years, its popularity has only risen in and around the state. Reviews from both users and auto industry experts have been extremely positive.
